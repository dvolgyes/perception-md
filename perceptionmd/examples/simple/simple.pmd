Participation in research
-------------------------

Your participation in this study is completely voluntary.
If you don't want to take part in it, or you change your
mind later, you can withdraw yourself anytime without any consequence,
and you don't have to explain your decision.

If you feel uncomfortable with any if the questions, then you

}

Content: [thanks.md] {
Thank you for your time, that was all.

If you have any final comment or feedback,
then please this is the time to let us know.
}

Content: [thanksbut.md] {
Thank you for your time, but unfortunatelly, if you do not accept the conditions,
then you can't participate in the study.
}

Content: [login.md] {
In order to perform the experiment, we need some information about you.

Would you be kind to fill the fields below?
}


Content: [raw_vol_question.md] {
Which volume is sharper? Hint: right button+move (or scroll button):scroll, left+ move up/down: window center, left+left/right: window width.
Ctrl speeds up these with a factor of 5.
}

Content: [raw_vol_question2.md] {
You can rotate the volume, flip axes, add color map (or use the predefined matplotlib color maps).
}
